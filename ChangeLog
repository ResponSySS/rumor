  RELEASE 1.0.4
29.8.2004
  Fixed typo in sources URL. Thanks to aamehl@[..].it
  RELEASE 1.0.3b
21.5.2004
  Homepage changed, hence updated package as 1.0.3a; no changes otherwise
29.2.2004
  MidiNote's and  LyNote's pitch member replaced by std::map pitches
    and std::set pitches respectively
  Notator::PitchOrChordName appeared, wrapping the Notator::PitchName for
    chords (enclosing in "<" and ">")
  Notator::NoteOn and Notator::NoteOff substantially enhanced to support chords
  new option --no-chords
  new guile command (rumor-beats)
  added doc/drums.scm to distribution as example of (rumor-beats)
  docs updated accordingly
  RELEASE 1.0.3
14.9.2003
  finished lang.hh integration into sources
  lang is taken into account when processing command-line arguments
  missing break bugfix, Notator constructor changes
  tried drums at channel 10, does not work (worked already, what the hell
    happens here?), see metronome.cc, at the beginning
31.8.2003
  added --explicit-durations, --absolute-pitches,
    --pitch-names={nederlands,italiano}
  accordingly extended Options class
  reorganized note_names[] assignemnt
  tried using gettext for pitch names, bloated, commented out
  docs updated accordingly
13.6.2003
  changed slightly sample sheet output (lower octave),
    uses subscript rather than \mark for key label
  changed "asas" -> "ases" in defaults (as in Lilypond "netherlands" default)
  option check for double sharp/flat key
  RELEASE 1.0.1  
12.6.2003
  added #include<rumor.hh> to guile2cc.cc (broke linkage with g++ 3.3)
5.6.2003
  documentation updates
  pitch names are stored in a hash; this will enable scriptable pitch names
  added --flat, suppressing all quantization and timing in lilypond output  
  added (rumor-pitches), implemented in Notator::gh_rumor_pitches
  gh_rumor_rhythms: rhythms ending after barline are skipped with error report  
  docs updates
  RELEASE 1.0.0
19.5.2003
  RELEASE 0.9.5
16.5.2003
  added -D,--no-dots (bool Options::NoDots)
  fixed metronome thread cancellation if still waiting for MIDI (&thread was NULL)
  fixed Notator::~Notator trailing rests if nothing was played (illegal address request, garbage value)
  ostringstream in Notator::PrintNote may randomly changed
    pMetronome->TU_bar (and maybe something else)
    if written to like 10000 times, don't know why (not a bug, this "never" arrives)
  fixed bug in high-latency correction in Metronome::QuantizeNow (negative notes durations, failed assertions)  
14.5.2003
  added -s,--strip -w,--wait[=BEAT]
  -s is no longer short form of --script
  thread management reorganisation (static members of MidiClient and Metronome)
    if --wait, metronome thread will be started by metronome itself
    upon first quantization request
  by default, print leading and trailing spaces (so that all bars are complete)
    use --strip to suppress this behavior
  Options::SanityCheck updated accordingly
  Exitting (in ~Notator) will close last note (as if note-off were generated) and print it
  RELEASE 0.9.4
4.5.2003
  massive code reorganisation; options.cc and guile2cc.hh added
  class script_error: public std::exception added
  script error handling uses exceptions
  int pOptions->SanityCheck(void) added (checks options consistency)
  --full header removed from main, moved to Notator::Notator
  main::CoutTail removed, things are taken care of in Notator::~Notator
  other code cleanups 
  RELEASE 0.9.3  
3.5.2003
  kbdclient.cc: use Instr and Channel members to echo
  --verbose dos not take number option because is interprets -vv as --verbose=v
2.5.2003
  (rumor-rhythms): first arg (list of grain, P, Q) exploded into 3 args
  new (rumor-kbd ...)
  pOptions renamed to pOpts; MeterNumer-->MeterP; MeterDenom-->MeterQ
  guile2cc.hh --> guile2cc.cc; declarations to rumor.hh
  doc update, incl. (rumor-kbd) with example
  --verbose option can take a number, increasing verbosity by that number
  --alsa can take just one pair C:P, meaning output client and port
  rhythm68.scm and kbd_ex.scm are in doc
    these 2 and also png and eps figures are in distribution package (make dist)
  configure report error if there is nor ALSA nor OSS
  --script can be specified more times; all scripts will be run sequentially
  Makefile has target html for texi2html in doc
1.5.2003
  kbdclient.cc, class KbdMidiClient
  got rid of MidiThread (MidiClient::Loop() in the main flow thread)
  option --kbd
  added .eps figures to doc (generated by ly2dvi --keep, headers removed from latex file, latex, dvips, convert .ps .eps)
  signal handling changed (sigsuspend)
  added MidiThread again
  global std::string CoutTail moved to main2
  DEBUGMSG takes new first argument (level)
  all messages are nicely intended, depending on importance
  configure.ac changes CXXFLAGS if doing (non)debug build
  configure shows feature summary at the end
29.4.2003
  changed --granularity to --grain
  --grain argument is 32 for 32th note, not 5
  dtto for (rumor-rhythms ...): '(32 6 8), not '(5 6 8)
  if (rumor-rhythms) are more coarse than current granularity, multiply them accordingly
  changed --meter syntax to: P/Q, or PQ if P<10 && Q<10
  check that meterQ<grain
  first note should always have explicit duration (UNTESTED)
  fixed --alsa= option parsing
28.4.2003
  texinfo documentation mostly finished
25.4.2003
  switched to autoconf, automake, autoheader, cvsbuild.sh calls these in proper order
24.4.2003
  key setting influences sample-sheet (scales only)
  addede #ifdef INCLUDE* to headers
  changed (rumor-rhythms ...) syntax ( rumor-rhythms bar-spec-rest-list)
  logging and debugging macros: LOG(level,msg), TRFL, TREXP, TRCMD
