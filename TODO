short-term:
add sanity checks for rumor-beats arguments (such as instrument number <128 etc.)
change example in doc so that it shows off with chords also :-)
add some links to projects/people using rumor
someone test thoroughly the OSS interface (not via ALSA emulation, please)
use atexit() to restore terminal settings if rumor exits abnormally (?)

long-term:
OSS metronome may clash with keyboard (if on the same pitch) (someone test this!)
DONE: use MIDI drums for metronome? (how?: use (rumor-beats))
do not switch MIDI instruments with OSS interface
DONE: optionally, produce absolute Lilypond pitches (needed?)
manual tempo adjustements on-the-fly (needed?)
key adjustement on-the-fly (needed?)
(on-the-fly goodies aswell as kbd input need some kind of UI; ncurses?)

Feedback on these and other useful ideas is appreciated.
